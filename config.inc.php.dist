** header (you can use custom headers here) and ruleX a list of letters, each
** one identifying a matching rule you want to enable. Available rules are:
**
** - e (exact):  an address found in headers can be used if it exactly matches
**               one of your identities
** - p (prefix): an address found in headers can be used if it exactly matches
**               one of your identities with an optional +suffix
** - d (domain): an address found in headers can be used if its domain matches
**               one of your identities
** - o (other):  any address found in header can be used
**
** By default "prefix" matching rule is enabled on headers known to contain
** e-mail addresses.
